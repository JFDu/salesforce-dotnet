#summary General outline of a road map for the salesforce-dotnet project. Cherry picking things to improve.

= Introduction =

Few conversations recently with committers on what to add, based on the brief to do list on the project homepage. Mostly around things to improve.

 * better support batch updates/adds
 * better support for receiving complex objects
 * better error handling
 * better logging
 * query via LINQ: LinqToSalesforce?
 * unit testing

= Details =

Starting simple.  Rolling in some Unit Testing with [http://www.nunit.org/ NUnit]:
  * mteece has a separate project using *salesforce-dotnet* with [http://www.nunit.org/ NUnit]
  * Create a branch from trunk see what can be incorporated
  * Some restructuring may have to take place, e.g. new folders like src/, /nunit/ so that everything is incorporated (read nobody has to run around downloading stuff)
